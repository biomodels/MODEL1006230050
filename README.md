# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Population dynamics of immune responses to persistent viruses.**   
Nowak MA, Bangham CR. _Science_ 1996 Apr 5;272(5258):74-9
[8600540](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8600540) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Mathematical models, which are based on a firm understanding of biological
interactions, can provide nonintuitive insights into the dynamics of host
responses to infectious agents and can suggest new avenues for
experimentation. Here, a simple mathematical approach is developed to explore
the relation between antiviral immune responses, virus load, and virus
diversity. The model results are compared to data on cytotoxic T cell
responses and viral diversity in infections with the human T cell leukemia
virus (HTLV-1) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1).
